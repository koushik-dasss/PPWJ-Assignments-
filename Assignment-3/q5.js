// A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game board can be represented using a 3x3
// two-dimensional array in JavaScript. The board contains numbers
// 1 to 9 in sequence. Your task is to:
// - Create a two-dimensional array to represent the board.
// - Write code to access and display the middle cell of the board (i.e.,
// the center element).
let board = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]; // tic-tac-toe board
console.log("The board is :" ,  board); // 2d array
let centerElement = board[1][1]; // center element 
console.log("The center element of the board is : ", centerElement);
